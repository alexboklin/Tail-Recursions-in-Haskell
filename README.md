This repository contains three tail recursive functions written in Haskell:

- **fibonacci** finds Fibonacci numbers (including negative ones)
- **seqA** finds the elements of the following recurrent sequence: a_0 = 1; a_1 = 2 ; a_2 = 3; a_{k+3} = a_{k+2} + a_{k+1} - 2 a_{k}
- **sum'n'count** returns the sum and the number of digits of a given integer
